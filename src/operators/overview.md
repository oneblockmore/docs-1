# Node Operator Overview

Beyond the Devnet, the Oasis Network's blockchain infrastructure will be
composed of a number of Node Operators. These Node Operators will manage various
parts of the network's decentralized architecture. In order to reach this
future, we are providing documentation that assists any individual or
organization in participating in the network as a Node Operator.

In the coming months, the code and tooling will become available for the general
public to join the Oasis Network. The Node Operator docs available here will be
continuously updated as more information becomes available.
